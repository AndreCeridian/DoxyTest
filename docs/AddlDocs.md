# Additional Documentation

## Creating Documentation

Documentation can be created for this project by creating a new Markdown (.md) file, and adding any required text to that file. Additionally, an existing .md file can be edited and added to. 

These files take standard Markdown formatting. 

A title, denoted by a `#`, will appear as the page title and the selector in the sidebar. 
A secondary header, denoted by a `##`, will appear as a header on the page and cascading selectors in the sidebar.

If images are required in your documentation, they should be added to the /docs/attachments folder, and referenced in your documentation.
